            <p>Before practicing learning the vowels and root syllables, we expect you to have some basic familiarity
                of how they sound. Please go to the 'Characters' link above first if you are a complete
                beginner to Nepali, or, if, for you, the 'black letters as same as the buffaloes', as they say in
                Nepali.</p>

            <h2>The Thrill of Learning Language</h2>
            <p> I now know many languages besides my native Nepali. I know Hindi. I also know some bit of Bhojpuri and
                Maithili. In the last one year, I learned two other languages, thanks to the internet: French and
                Spanish. I learned them on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" title="Duolingo" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>.
                <p> I have developed this app after I acquired the thrill of learning new languages on Duolingo. I am
                    convinced that anyone can learn new languages fast, provided they have right tools at hand.
                    Learning languages
                    also expands your world, and makes available resources that you did not know existed.</p>
                <p>If you truly want to know what's going on in Nepal, then learning Nepali is a must. The written
                    Nepali has exploded in the scene. People have been writing on social media and Nepal's publishing
                    has flourished in the last three decades.</p>
                <p>I present this app as a gift to the world.</p>
                <p>Let's begin! </p>

            <h2>Vowels and Root Syllables</h2>
            <p>Nepali is based on 12 vowels, 36 root syllables and decimal numerical system. We will explore the
                numerical system later in the lessons.</p>
            <h3>Vowels</h3>
            <section id="vowel-list">
                <div>अ/a</div>
                <div>आ/aa</div>
                <div>इ/i</div>
                <div>ई/ee</div>
                <div>उ/u</div>
                <div>ऊ/oo</div>
                <div>ए/e</div>
                <div>ऐ/eih</div>
                <div>ओ/o</div>
                <div>औ/au</div>
                <div>अं/ahm</div>
                <div>अ:/aha</div>
            </section>
            <p>Pay particular attention to the making of the root syllables. They are composed of vowels and root
                consonants. For example, <strong>क (ka)</strong> is made up of <strong>क् (k) ‌+ अ (a)</strong>. Same
                goes with
                other root syllables. </p>
            <p>Ultimately,
                each of the root syllables are expanded into 12 versions depending on which vowels they are combined
                with. This means, once you know how to compose 12-iterations of one root syllables, you will be able to
                do that for all others. </p>
            <h3>Root Syllables</h3>
            <section id="syllable-list">
                <div>क/ka</div>
                <div>ख/Kha</div>

            <p>It is better to have basic familiarity with these vowels and root syllables before we practice typing
                them. You might want to print them out and put it up on your wall by the computer.</p>
            <p>Once you learn basic characters, words and sentences, you will be able to enhance your Nepali language
                competence by regular practice of writing, reading, talking, and reading out loud. From the basics
                onwards, you
                are on your own, a bird soaring high and exploring the new world that has opened up!</p>

            <p>Practice learning the vowels and root syllables.</p>
