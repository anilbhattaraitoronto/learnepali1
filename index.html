            <h2>Start Learning</h2>
            <p class="intro">Learning new language is a thrilling experience. I started learning 4 new languages in the
                summer of
                2017: two human ones (French and Spanish), and two computer ones (JavaScript and Python). I learned all
                these languages with resources available on the internet. I made this app by using my insights and
                knowledge gained freely. Hence, I will try my best to make most of this app's lessons and other
                materials for free.</p>

            <h3>The Thrill of Learning Language</h3>
            <p class="intro"> I now know many languages besides my native Nepali. I know Hindi. I also know some
                bit of
                Bhojpuri and
                Maithili. In the last one year, I learned two other languages, thanks to the internet: French and
                Spanish. I learned them on <a href="https://www.duolingo.com" title="Duolingo" target="_blank">Duolingo</a>.
                <p> I have developed this app after I acquired the thrill of learning new languages on Duolingo. I
                    am
                    convinced that anyone can learn new languages fast, provided they have right tools at hand, and
                    they are enthusiastic.
                    Learning languages expands your world, and makes available resources that you did not know
                    existed.Besides the two human languages, I also learned two computer languages in the last one
                    year: JavaScript and Python. I made this app using JavaScript. I also read French novels,
                    listen to
                    podcasts in French, and watch French movies.</p>
                <p>If you truly want to know what's going on in Nepal, then learning Nepali is a must. The written
                    Nepali has exploded in the scene. People have been sharing their ideas and life on the social
                    media. Nepal's publishing
                    has flourished in the last three decades.</p>
                <p>Given my experience of learning the four languages(two human and two computer languages), I am
                    totally convinced that, even if you are completely new to Nepali language, you can master it
                    fast
                    with good practice</p>
                <p>I will try to put into use my own experience of learning completely new languages in designing
                    lessons and other materials.</p>

                        <h3>Conjugated Syllables</h3>
                        <p>Pay particular attention to the making of the root syllables. They are composed of vowels
                            and root
                            consonants. For example, <strong>क (ka)</strong> is made up of <strong>क् (k) ‌+ अ (a)</strong>.
                            Same
                            goes with
                            other root syllables. </p>
                        <p>Each of the 36 primary syllables have 12 conjugated syllables. These conjugated syllables
                            are made up of primary consonant of each primary syllable and combined with 12 vowels.
                            Examples: क् ‌+ अ = क; ख् + आ ‍= खा, etc.. </p>
                        <p>Ultimately,
                            each of the root syllables are expanded into 12 conjugated syllables depending on which
                            vowels they are
                            combined
                            with. This means, once you know how to compose 12-iterations of one root syllables, you
                            will be able to
                            do that for all others.</p>

                        <p>You might want to print these vowels and root syllables and put it up on your wall by your
                            computer.</p>
                        <p>Once you learn basic characters, words and sentences, you will be able to enhance your
                            Nepali language
                            competence by regular practice of writing, reading, talking, and reading out loud.</p>
